# STIX 2 implementation in Gson

Implementation of the STIX 2 specification in Java based on the Gson serializer including an implemetnation of STIX patterns

### Quickstart

Typically when consuming STIX messages you typically receive a Bundle. To deserialize a received Bundle do this:

```java
Bundle bundle = Stix2Gson.PRODUCTION.fromJson(jsonString, Bundle.class);
```

In the next example we programmatically create a STIX Identity and serialize it to JSON.

```java
//create a UUID type 4 in line with the STIX spec
UUID uuid = UUID.randomUUID();
//create Identity object
Identity identity = new Identity(
        "identity--" + uuid.toString(),
        "CS-Aware",
        "organisation",
        LocalDateTime.now(),
        LocalDateTime.now()
);
//set additional attributes
identity.setDescription("This is the CS-Aware prototype.");
//serialize it
String serializedJson = Stix2Gson.PRODUCTION.toJson(identity);
 ```
